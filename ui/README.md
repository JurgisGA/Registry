# Registry UI

This directory contains the Vue 3 + Vuetify single page application for the Dynamic Registry Builder.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The app expects `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to be set, pointing to the Laravel API. In the Docker setup this is provided automatically.

Run unit tests with:

```bash
pnpm run test
```
